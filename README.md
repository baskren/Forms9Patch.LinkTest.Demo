# Forms9Patch LinkTest Demo App

Simple demo app showing `Forms9Patch.Label` action tag links and `Forms9Patch.ModalPopup` in action.

Forms9Patch has a lot of cool features to make your Xamarin.Forms app development easier - but getting started can be a bit intimidating. 
This demo app shows a very basic XAML based Forms9Patch app that runs on iOS, Android, and UWP.  It is referenced by the Forms9Patch Getting Started Guide (coming soon).
