# Forms9Patch LinkTest Demo App

Simple demo app showing `Forms9Patch.Label` action tag links and `Forms9Patch.ModalPopup` in action.

Forms9Patch has a lot of cool features to make your Xamarin.Forms app development easier - but getting started can be a bit intimidating. 
This demo app shows a very basic XAML based Forms9Patch app that runs on iOS, Android, and UWP.  It is referenced by the [Forms9Patch Getting Started Guide for Windows](https://bitbucket.org/baskren/forms9patch2/src/master/Forms9Patch/Forms9Patch.DocFX/guides/GettingStartedWindows.md).

## User Guide

The [Forms9Patch User Guide](https://bitbucket.org/baskren/forms9patch2/src/master/Forms9Patch/Forms9Patch.DocFX/index.md) is a work in progress. That being said, you'll find basic information on how to use Forms9Patch and an API reference.
